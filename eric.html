	<br>
	<p>Eric is one of our four rescue llamas.<br> He and his friend Yani came to us at the end of 2009 after having been kept as “ornaments” in a field for around 6 years, after which it appears the owners sold the property, moved away and just left Eric and <a href="yani.html">Yani</a> in the field.</p>
	<p>We are not sure of Eric's exact age but believe he was born sometime around 2003.<br><br> Although he was left unhandled for around 6 years, Eric very quickly settled in with us and now thoroughly enjoys his walks.<br> He is our smallest llama, but makes up for this by standing on the top of banks at every given opportunity – in fact there is even a bank at the top of one of the fields which we know call “Eric's Bank”.</p>

	<br>
	<p>Although not the sharpest tool in the box (he is easily confused!) Eric is a real sweetie and has lovely eyelashes which he likes to flutter at whoever is walking with him! He recently "starred" in an article in The Lady Magazine. (See our <a href="articles.html">Media Coverage page</a> for the full article).</p>

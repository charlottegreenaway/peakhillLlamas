	<img src="harry01.jpg" style="float:right" width=14%>
	<p>Harry “The Hooligan” is a particularly cheeky chap who is full of personality and always up to mischief!<br> One of our four rescue llamas, he came with his half-brother <a href="george.html">George</a> from somebody who had been breeding llamas and had ended up with far too many on a limited area of land.</p>
	<p>Harry was born on 3rd August 2011 and came to us in January 2013.<br> His hobbies include chasing cats, stealing brushes from the grooming box, stealing people's hats, dismantling tractors and generally causing mayhem!</p>

<div id="section2">
	<img src="harry02.jpg" style ="float:left" width=15%>
	<p>He, like <a href="golly.html">Golly</a>, loves to be the centre of attention, loves meeting people and strangely for a llama also loves a cuddle – so we are hoping that when he is a little older and (hopefully!) a little more sensible he will make a good Therapy Llama, visiting nursing homes, day centres and schools for children with additional needs.<br> In the meantime he enjoys going out for walks and generally likes to be out in front – so that he is the first to spot anything interesting!</p>

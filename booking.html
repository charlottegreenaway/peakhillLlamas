	<center><h2>Book A Walk Or Experience</h2></center>
	<h3>Bookings</h3>
<div id="section1">
	<p>We suggest that you book your walk well in advance as we do get very busy especially during the summer. <a href="contact.html">Contact Us</a> to check availability of dates and to make a provisional booking. We will hold provisional bookings for one week, at which time we will need a deposit of 33% to confirm the booking. The balance can be paid on the day of your walk either by cash or cheque with a valid bank card.</p>
</div>
	<h3>Vouchers</h3>
<div id="section1">
	<p>If you buy or are given a voucher, this will entitle you to participate in a llama walk, at a date to be arranged before the expiry date shown on the voucher. Vouchers are valid for one year from date of issue. No refunds will be made for unused vouchers. Vouchers are not redeemable for cash.</p>
</div>
	<h3>Eligibility</h3>
<div id="section1">
	<p>Although you do not need to be exceptionally fit to come walking with llamas, you do need to be in reasonably good health. We will do our best to adapt walks for those with special needs.</p>
	<p>Our llama walks are not suitable for children under 6 years old, unless by special arrangement. Children under 16 must be accompanied by an adult.</p>

	<p>We recommend wearing sensible walking shoes or boots, and advise against wearing shorts due to the possibility of ticks being present in areas of long grass. Please be aware that some areas of the farm may be muddy especially after periods of rain.</p>

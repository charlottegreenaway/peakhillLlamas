	<p>Yani is one of our four rescue llamas .<br> He came to us with <a href="eric.html">Eric</a> at the end of 2009 after having been kept as “ornaments” in a field for around 6 years, after which it appears the owners sold the property, moved away and just left <a href="eric.html">Eric</a> and Yani in the field.</p>

<div id="section2">

	<p>We are not sure of Yani's exact age but believe he was born sometime around 2003.<br> He was left unhandled for around 6 years and also seems to have suffered from some inappropriate handling methods before he came to us which has left him very wary of being handled, particularly of having a halter put on him.<br> We are very slowly gaining his confidence so we are hoping that one day he will have the confidence to be able to join the other llamas on our walks.</p>

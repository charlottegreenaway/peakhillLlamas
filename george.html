	<img src="george01.jpg" style="float:right" width=14%>
	<p>George is one of our four rescue llamas.<br> He was born on 5th July 2011 and came to us with his half-brother <a href="harry.html">Harry</a> in January 2013 from somebody who had been breeding llamas and had ended up with far too many on a limited area of land.<br> Because of this George was quite ill through having a high worm burden when he first arrived with us, but thanks to our very good vet thankfully made a full recovery.</p>
	<p>George is a little more highly strung than Harry but is still very friendly.<br> He enjoys going for walks but can be a little lively so at the moment only tends to walk with people who are used to handling large animals.</p>

<div id="section2">
	<img src="george02.jpg" style ="float:left" width=15%>
	<br>
	<p>He enjoys getting up to mischief with his brother <a href="harry.html">Harry</a> (particularly stealing brushes and dismantling the tractor!) and being a very inquisitive llama he also likes to climb up the hedge to keep an eye on who is coming down the drive!</p>

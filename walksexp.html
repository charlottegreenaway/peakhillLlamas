<center><h2>Walks & Experiences</h2></center>
<h3>Create Your Own Experience!</h3>
<div id="section1">
	<img src="walksexp.jpg" style="float:right">
	<p>The experiences below are all bespoke – you can create your own unique experience from a selection of interactive activities, and we won’t ask you to join in with anybody else’s experience *</p>
	<p>(*excludes gift agency bookings – these experiences need to comply with the agencies’ agreed format)</p>
	<p>In order to make our bespoke experiences viable we do need each one to be for a minimum of two people.</p>
	<p>First choose and book the type of experience you’d like, and then on the day you can choose which activities you’d like to make up your experience. Our llamas specialise in helping anyone a bit nervous of big animals feel comfortable and relaxed around them.</p>
	<p>Family/group rates are available for all our experiences – please <a href="contact.html">contact us</a> with details of your family or group and we’ll work out a good rate for you all.</p>

</div>
<h3>Our Experiences</h3>
<h4>Meet And Greet</h4>
<div id="section1">
	<p>A very gentle experience of around 45 minutes where you’ll get to meet and interact with our friendly llamas. Learn some interesting things about them, feed and groom them, have a go at clicker training – or maybe have a short walk with a llama companion around the llama paddock.</p>
	<p>This experience normally starts at either 11 am or 2.30 pm but we can be flexible with start times if required.</p>
	<p><b>Cost:</b> £50 for two, extra person/s £20         <a href="vouchers.html">*Gift vouchers available</a></p>

</div>
<h4>Activity Session/Amble</h4>
<div id="section1">
	<p>A slightly more active experience of around one and a half hours including a choice of grooming, clicker training, llama agility (in the very loosest sense of the word!) and/or a gentle amble around the farm with a llama companion.</p>
	<p>This experience normally starts at either 10.30 am or 2.30 pm but we can be flexible with start times if required.</p>
	<p><b>Cost:</b> £70 for two, extra person/s £30  <a href="vouchers.html">*Gift vouchers available</a></p>

</div>
<h4>Full Morning </h4>
<div id="section1">
	<p>Spend around three and a half hours (including a short stop for elevensies!) really getting to know our lovely llamas. Help give them their breakfast, groom them and then have a go at some llama agility (in the very loosest sense of the word!) or clicker training before stopping for a muffin & mug of tea or coffee- and then finish the morning with a gentle amble with your chosen llama friend around the farm.</p>
	<p>This experience normally starts at 9.30 am.</p>
	<p><b>*This experience is not available on Sundays*</b></p>
	<p><b>Cost:</b> £140 for two, extra person/s £60 <a href="vouchers.html">*Gift vouchers available</a></p>

</div>
<h4>Husbandry</h4>
<div id="section1">
	<p>This experience of around two hours has been developed specifically for anybody thinking of keeping camelids or wishing to know a bit more about the day-to-day practicalities of looking after these unique animals. We’ll look at the type and amount of concentrate feed and forage we feed our llamas as well as the gentle handling and training techniques we use. We’ll also cover grooming, the choice and correct fitting of halters, gentle haltering and ways of working with nervous or previously unhandled llamas.</p>
	<p>This experience normally starts at either 10.30 am or 2.30 pm.</p>
	<p><b>Cost:</b> £90 for two, extra person/s £40</p>

</div>
<h3>Suitability</h3>
<div id="section1">
	<p>We regret that our walks and experiences are not suitable for:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>Children under 5, unless by special arrangement.</li>
		<li>Unaccompanied children - anybody under the age of 16 must be accompanied by a paying adult.</li>
		<li>Dogs, with the exception of assistance dogs or by special arrangement. Llamas view dogs as predators and are generally not comfortable walking with them. We do not have anywhere suitable to leave dogs whilst out on walks, and do not like them to be left in cars.</li>
		<li>Spectators or extra people who have not been booked in.</li>
	</ul>
	<p><a href="accomodation.html">Superb Bed and Breakfast</a> accommodation can be arranged at the farm, where a warm welcome and hearty breakfast is assured. Again, it is worth booking well in advance, particularly in the summer months.</p>

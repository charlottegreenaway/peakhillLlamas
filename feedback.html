	<p>Hi Maggie,</>
	<p>Just had to write and thank you for a great afternoon on Saturday! We laughed from start to finish and it was a real joy to be in the company of you and your lovely boys! We haven’t been able to totally relax like that for ages….everyone needs an afternoon with a Llama!!! You took some fab pics and I have attached the ones that made me laugh the most!</p>
	<p>Thanks again and hope to see you again soon!</p>

	<p>Hi Maggie,</p>
	<p>Thanks for a great afternoon with Ollie & Eric. Hazel & I enjoyed meeting and walking with the Llamas and hopefully the boys enjoyed the walk with two new humans. The cream tea was fantastic and was way passed any expectation. The following morning we walked the coat path, sadly without our new friends Ollie & Eric, but it was great to see them in their paddock from on top of High Peak.</p>
	<p>The weather was fantastic and I have attached a couple of pictures, I particularly like the one of Eric enjoying the view. Hopefully we will one day come down your way again and walk again with llamas.</p>
	<p>Thanks once more Chris</p>

	<p>Hi Maggie</p>
	<p>I just wanted to write and thank you and Paul for a superb afternoon last week. Mark and I thoroughly enjoyed ourselves with Golly and Olly, what characters they are. The countryside was perfect along with the weather and the walk was great. We slept well that night after all that fresh air. Anyway when we are down that way again we will pop in and say hello and may well see you at the Donkey sanctuary. Take care and thanks again.</p>

	<p>Hi Maggie, We’re back at home now but still with vivid memories of our walk with Eric and Olli. What an experience. If our friends knew that we had spent two hours walking with and talking to two Llamas…… It was a great afternoon and a lovely way to spend a few hours. We were lucky with the weather and so the views were fabulous. And the lovely cream tea was a wonderful way to end the experience. Highly recommended and we hope you continue to be successful with the walks and also, hopefully, with the goats. Best wishes</p>

	<p>Hi Maggie Just thought I'd get in touch and say how much Kitty and I enjoyed our walk with Olly and Golly last week - it was memorable! They are such characters and you are clearly very fond of them, we learned a lot about llamas that day and it was one of the highlights of our great week in Devon. It was lovely to meet you and the boys and we really hope to come back again one day... Claire and Kitty</p>

	<p>Hi Maggie – Ruth and I found the whole experience absolutely brilliant. Ollie and Eric awesome – Ruth was thrilled when Ollie bonded with her by putting his head on her shoulder during the walk. We have recommended ‘Walking with Peak Hill Llamas’ to our family, friends and colleagues as an unbeatable way to chill out whilst enjoying some beautiful countryside. Hope to do it again in the future. Thanks for your excellent guidance and commentary which helped make our birthday a really special occasion. Please feel free to use this as a recommendation on your web site. Cheers. Marion H & Ruth J.</p>

	<p>Hi Maggie</p>
	<p>I just wanted to say thank you so much for the wonderful walk John and I did with Jonesy, Golly and you on Tuesday morning. We did so enjoy it and I think that llamas are much under-rated beasties! I had no idea what characters they were. Thank you too for sharing your extensive knowledge of them with us. It was certainly a memorable experience for us both, not forgetting the lovely danish pastries and coffee in glorious surroundings, and one I hope to repeat in the not too distant future. I can't stop telling people about it, not least my yoga class on Tuesday evening who were most impressed!</p>
	<p>A gentle pat for your boys and special thanks to you.</p>

	<p>Hello Maggie

I wanted to send you an message to let you know how much fun we had on our llama experience on the 28th August. Jonesy was as silly as I had imagined and the faces he pulled had me in fits of laughter the entire day, Nik also had a big soft spot for Rufus this was proven when we got home, and as I was looking though the camera there were dozens of pictures of the two of them on there, so all that time when they were dragging behind it was because Nik was too busy taking pictures and Rufus seemed more than happy to oblige ha ha I think you are doing a fantastic job, our friends have all commented on how much fun it looked and a couple have even asked for your details. Thanks again for a truly unforgettable day. Take Care Vicky</p>

	<p>Dear Maggie.</p>

	<p>Thank you and your boys for the wonderful time we had with you last Tuesday. We have got some great photographs to remember the day. We still keep talking about it. It was something we will remember for a long time. You haven't seen the last of us it was the first time we had been to Sidmouth but we loved the place so will be there again. Love to Ollie and Golly.</p>

	<p>Hi, Maggie</p>

	<p>I just wanted to say how much we all enjoyed ourselves yesterday and to thank you for making it such fun. The weather was kinder than we had dared hope as we sat in the pub at lunchtime, and the afternoon was a huge success. Many thanks to you and to Maisie and "the boys". Liz</p>

	<p>Hi Maggie,</p>

	<p>Just wanted to write and say how much we all enjoyed our llama walk for Laura's Birthday. It was a complete surprise for Laura, who only found out on the Tuesday (31st July) that we were off for a trek...... Laura loved Golly, who reminded her of herself. I completely adored Blitzen who brings a smile to my face whenever I think about him and it made it for me that he just came when asked after our cream tea stop. .... Although Emily was a bit reluctant and is very scared around any large animals she really enjoyed her walk, obviously the weather was fantastic but the cream tea made it for her. So thank you once again for such a wonderful time, when we get down to Devon again we shall definitely be in touch for another walk. Love to you and all your llamas Lize Kevin Emily and Laura</p>

	<p>Hi Maggie,</p>

	<p>Thanks for a lovely morning last week, hope we didn't outstay our welcome. It was the best birthday present I ever had. Hope Ben and Guy are still doing well. Regards Barbara</p>

<div id="section1">
	<p>Hi Maggie and Paul</p>

	<p>Thank you so much for the trek – you organised it so well. My brother and sister really enjoyed as well and it was far the best xmas present I’ve had in a long time. I also enclose some Peru pictures with some furry friends for your interest! Hey isn’t Machu Picchu a cool place to live if you are Llama! Here are some pix including one or two with Jonesy with his ears up! And of course a few with his ears down! I will never be able to watch Samuel L Jackson again without thinking of Llamas!</p>

	<p>I would certainly recommend a visit! Kind regards Heather</p>

	<p>Hi Maggie</p>

	<p>Just wanted to say what a fantastic time we had with you and "the boys" on Sunday 11th April, we thoroughly enjoyed our walk with beautiful sceenery and the Llamas were such good fun, very individual each with their own character. I think Mr Jones was lovely!! Our friends who we came with didn't know they were doing the walk until the previous evening so it was a great surprise which they thouroughly enjoyed! I have just looked at your website and the pictures and reading about each one was great after meeting them all. A wonderful experience which I would recommend to anyone!!</p>

	<p>Thank you very much</p>

	<p>Kind regards (love to Jonesy) Jane, Peter, Dawn & Stewart (Jonesy, Rufus, Golly & Ben)</p>

	<p>Hi Maggie</p>

	<p>Just wanted to e-mail to say thanks for a fab day yesterday with Ollie and Jonesy! It was great meeting you all! I loved the llama trekking and Lucy said to say thank you too. The llamas were great, Jonesy was really funny and Ollie was absolutely perfect for me. It was nice to meet all the other llamas aswell, I think I fell in love with Eric! We really enjoyed the walk and the scenery and the cream tea was yummy too - Lucy had her other scone for breakfast this morning ha ha! I've attached a couple of pictures of Lucy and Jones enjoying the view, thought you might like it! I will definitely give you a bell if i'm in the area someday so I can come and say hi to you all. I can bring the llamas some carrots</p>

	<p>Anyway take care and thanks again, Donna :-)</p>

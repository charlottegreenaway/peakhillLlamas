<h2>Accomodation</h2>
<div id="section1">
	<p>Gordon and Betty Sage, who run the farm where we keep our llamas, offer extremely comfortable Bed and Breakfast accomodation in the farmhouse. In recognition of their excellent facilities they have been awarded 4 diamonds and a Silver Award by the English Tourist Board. All rooms are en-suite and have colour TVs and hot drink making facilities. One of the rooms has views over the llamas’ paddock.</p>

	<p>Gordon and Betty will look after you extremely well - and one of their hearty farmhouse breakfasts will really set you up for the day. (Remember to leave some room for your elevenses if you are coming out on one of our morning walks!)</p>
	<p>For further details please contact Mrs Betty Sage on 01395 514004, or e-mail: <a href="mailto:bettysage@pinnbartonfarm.co.uk">bettysage@pinnbartonfarm.co.uk</a></p>

	<p style="color:red">Please note that Gordon and Betty do not take bookings for the llama walks - these need to be booked separately with Maggie at Peak Hill Llamas.</p>
	<p>If you are looking for alternative types of accommodation, or if Betty doesn't have any availability on the dates you require you can find a selection of hotels, guest houses, cottages and camp sites in the area from the following:</p>
	<ul>
		<li>For self catering accommodation we also recommend having a look at <a href="HolidayCottages.net">HolidayCottages.net</a></li>
		<li>If you are looking for a holiday park as a base to explore Devon or West Dorset, Parkdean Holiday Parks have two award winning parks within 30 miles of the farm – one at <a href="https://www.parkdeanresorts.co.uk/location/devon/torquay/">Torquay</a> and one at <a href="https://www.parkdeanresorts.co.uk/location/dorset/west-bay/">West Bay</a> – we are about mid-way between the two!</li>
		<li>We also have a <a href="https://www.haven.com/parks/devon/devon-cliffs">Haven Holiday Park</a> less than 10 miles from the farm - Devon Cliffs at Sandy Bay just outside Exmouth – an ideal base for families to explore our lovely region!</li>
	</ul>

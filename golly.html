	<p1><a href="ourllamas.html">back</p1></a> <center><h2>Golly</h2></center>
	<img src="golly01.jpg" style="float:right" width=14%>
	<p>Golly was born on 3rd December 2002 and was bought from Llyndy Llamas in April 2007, arriving on April Fool's Day which is quite appropriate for him as he has a highly developed sense of humour and is quite a joker! He is a very intelligent and friendly llama and absolutely loves to be the centre of attention – he loves to have his photo taken and particularly likes posing for “Selfies”!</p>
	<p>Golly is quite unusual as he has one pale blue eye and one dark blue one but has normal vision.<br> He is <a href="guy.html">Guy's</a> younger brother – not quite as opinionated as Guy but equally ruled by his stomach - he very much views our walks as buffets, stopping as often as he can get away with to have a munch on the hedges!</p>

<div id="section2">
	<img src="golly02.jpg" style ="float:left" width=15%>
	<p>Golly really enjoys going out to community events where he can be the centre of attention– his favourite being the annual Exeter Nativity where he dresses up as a camel and gets to stand and be admired by all the congregation in Exeter Cathedral!</p>
